      "Known as one of the most popular and well known types of coffee bean, Arabica beans are the most commonly produced variety and are considered higher quality beans. In fact, over 60% of the coffee beans in the world that are produced are Arabica variety. These beans are grown at high altitudes and need to be in an area that has a steady rainfall and plenty of shade. Perhaps one of the reasons that this is a variety of coffee bean that is seen the world over is because the trees are easy to care for, they are reasonably small and they are easy to prune too. Although they are delicate and can be affected by their environment. Arabica is both full of flavour and aroma.",

      "Robusta is the second most produced in the world. As the name hints, the Robusta bean is both hardy and is also immune to a variety of diseases too. This type of coffee bean grows best in a hot climate with irregular rainfall and can grow at a number of altitudes too. Compared to Arabica beans, those that grow on the Robusta plant have double the amount of caffeine in them, meaning that they are an excellent choice for a real boost and offer a more harsh flavour. The beans also have a smooth texture and it is often said that they even have a slight chocolate hint to them, which makes them ideal to have with milk and sugar (perhaps as an iced coffee).",

      "First discovered in Africa, most of the Excelsa beans processed today are grown almost exclusively in Southeast Asia. With a slightly elongated oval shape, the Excelsa bean grows well in medium altitudes. Excelsa coffee beans are known for their incredibly complex flavor profile and are commonly used in coffee blends for added dimension. Its delicious flavor also makes the Excelsa bean a popular stand-alone brew choice. Compared to other types of coffee beans, Excelsa beans combine light and dark roast traits to produce unique flavors ranging from fruity and tart to rich and bold. The unusual depth of the Excelsa flavor makes the bean difficult to find outside of Southeast Asia, so this type may need to be sourced from a specialty retailer. ",
